    "degrading, i.e. our model would quickly start to _overfit_ to the training data. Overfitting happens in every single machine learning \n",
    "problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. \"Optimization\" refers to the process of \n",
    "adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the \"learning\" in \"machine learning\"), while \"generalization\" \n",
    "refers to how well the trained model would perform on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of \n",
    "course, but you do not control generalization; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on \n",
    "test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be _under-fit_: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet \n",
    "modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops \n",
    "improving, validation metrics stall then start degrading: the model is then starting to over-fit, i.e. is it starting to learn patterns \n",
    "that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, _the best solution is of course to get \n",
    "more training data_. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution \n",
    "is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to \n",
    "store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most \n",
    "prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

    "The processing of fighting overfitting in this way is called _regularization_. Let's review some of the most common regularization \n",
    "techniques, and let's apply them in practice to improve our movie classification model from  the previous chapter."

    "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which is \n",
    "determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is \n",
    "often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore \n",
    "will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any \n",
    "generalization power. For instance, a model with 500,000 binary parameters could easily be made to learn the class of every digits in the \n",
    "MNIST training set: we would only need 10 binary parameters for each of the 50,000 digits. Such a model would be useless for classifying \n",
    "new digit samples. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge \n",
    "is generalization, not fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in \n",
    "order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets \n",

    "found between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",

    "You may be familiar with _Occam's Razor_ principle: given two explanations for something, the explanation most likely to be correct is the \n",
    "\"simplest\" one, the one that makes the least amount of assumptions. This also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some \n",
    "training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple _models_) that could explain the data, and \n",
    "simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"simple model\" in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy (or a model with fewer \n",
    "parameters altogether, as we saw in the section above). Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity \n",
    "of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\". This is called \n",
    "\"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a _cost_ associated with having large weights. This \n",
    "cost comes in two flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _absolute value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called the \n",
    "\"L1 norm\" of the weights).\n",
    "* L2 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _square of the value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called \n",
    "the \"L2 norm\" of the weights). L2 regularization is also called _weight decay_ in the context of neural networks. Don't let the different \n",
    "name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, weight regularization is added by passing _weight regularizer instances_ to layers as keyword arguments. Let's add L2 weight \n",
